# Sakila Database Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves connecting to the **MySQL Sakila Database**, executing SQL queries to extract key insights, and performing in-depth data analysis and visualization using **Python** and **Pandas**. The analysis focuses on various aspects of the Sakila movie rental system, including:

- **Movie Rentals**: Analyzing the most popular movies and rental trends over time.

- **Customer Behavior**: Understanding customer purchase patterns, rental frequency, and segmentation.

- **Revenue Trends**: Identifying revenue generation patterns and seasonal trends.

- **Staff Performance**: Evaluating staff efficiency in handling rentals and the revenue they generate.

By leveraging **SQL** for querying the database and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** for analysis and visualization, this project aims to extract actionable insights from the dataset. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the business performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency within the Sakila movie rental system.


## Introduction
The Sakila database is a sample database provided by MySQL, typically used for practicing SQL queries and database management. This project utilizes the Sakila database to demonstrate various SQL queries, data analysis with Python, and visualizations.


## Database
- Database Used: [Sakila Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/)

- Type: MySQL Relational Database

#### Description:
Sakila models a DVD rental store with information about:

- Customers
- Films and categories
- Rentals and payments
- Staff and stores

#### Tables Involved:

- customer
- rental
- payment
- film
- category
- staff
- store
- city
- country


## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)

- MySQL (Sakila Database)

- Pandas

- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualizations)


## Project Structure

- **SQL Queries**: Extract relevant data from the Sakila database using complex SQL queries (joins, aggregation, and filtering).

- **Pandas Analysis**: Further analyzed data in Python.

- **Observations and Insights**: Summarized findings after each analysis.

- **Conclusion**: Final interpretation of business performance and customer behavior.


 ## Key Analysis Performed

 #### Movies Insights
 - Top 10 most rented Films.
 - Movies available in most stores.
 - Count of movies by category.
 - Average rental duration per category.

#### Revenue Analysis
- Total revenue generated by each film.
- Revenue by customer (top spenders).
- Monthly revenue trend.
- Revenue by store.

#### Customer Behavior
- Number of rentals per customer.
- Customers who haven’t rented anything in the last 3 months.
- Active vs inactive customers.

#### Geographic Analysis
- Number of customers per country.
- Total revenue per country.
- Top cities by rentals.

#### Time-Based Trends
- Number of rentals per month.
- Peak rental hours (using rental datetime).
- Seasonal trends in rentals.

#### Staff & Store Insights
- Rentals handled by each staff member.
- Revenue generated by each staff member.
- Store-wise rental count.


## Key Insights
- Sports, Foreign, and Family are the most popular movie categories.

- Travel movies have the longest average rental duration.

- TELEGRAPH VOYAGE generated the highest revenue among films.

- India and China contributed the highest number of customers and revenue.

- Rentals peaked during summer months (June–August).

- 15:00 (3 PM) was the most active rental hour.

- Staff members Mike Hillyer and Jon Stephens handled rentals almost equally.


## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how combining **SQL, Python (Pandas)**, and **data visualization** techniques can uncover valuable business insights from a relational database.

By analyzing the **Sakila movie rental system**, we identified key trends in **customer behavior, revenue generation**, and **store and staff performance**.

The findings highlight critical areas such as peak rental periods, top revenue contributors, and customer engagement patterns — all essential for making data-driven business decisions.

This end-to-end analysis not only strengthened database querying and data wrangling skills but also emphasized the importance of storytelling through data for business impact.

With a solid foundation built through this project, future steps include developing **interactive dashboards**, applying **advanced analytics**, and extending the approach to real-world business scenarios.
